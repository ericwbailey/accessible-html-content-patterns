# [Accessible HTML Content Patterns](http://ericwbailey.github.io/accessible-html-content-patterns/)

A collection of the full [HTML5 Doctor Element Index](http://html5doctor.com/element-index/), minus the `<command>` and `<menu>` tags (which have [poor browser support](http://caniuse.com/#search=menu)), as well as common markup patterns for quick reference.


## Motivation
There are countless little gotchas and quirks to remember when writing markup, even for basic components. This is an attempt to capture and centralize them.

Use this as a starting point when creating your base markup and styling for a stable, progressively enhanced foundation to your site or app, or cherry-pick as needed.


## Installation
There are a few of ways to work with this repo:

- Clone it in its entirety: `https://github.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns.git`
- [Download a zipped copy](https://github.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns/archive/master.zip)
- Install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessible-html-content-patterns): `npm i accessible-html-content-patterns`
- [Curl](http://explainshell.com/explain/1/curl) just the HTML page (great starting place for a styleguide):
`curl -o accessible-html-content-patterns.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns/master/docs/index.html`
- Copy/paste individual elements from the [source code](https://github.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns/blob/master/docs/index.html)

To review any changes you make locally, run `make build` from the command line. This will stitch the handlebar templates together to update [`docs/index.html`](https://github.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns/blob/master/docs/index.html).

## Code Concerns

### Classes and IDs
Are suggestions only, or used for internal navigation/reference. Don't feel you need to include them if they're not relevant to your component's needs.

### Code Style
Tabs, indentation, comments, etc. are my personal preference. It's more important to be consistent than literal when using for your own project. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to help make this easier.

### Accessibility Testing
This page has been tested via the Chrome DevTools [Accessibility Audit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en), as well as  [WebAIM's WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/) and [Deque System's aXe](http://www.deque.com/products/axe/#aXeExtensions) accessibility testing browser extensions, as well as [Khan Academy's tota11y bookmarklet](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/).

Answers to specific warnings issues are available on the [repo's Wiki](https://github.com/ericwbailey/accessible-html-content-patterns/wiki).

**A note about [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA):** ARIA is a band-aid and [not a cure-all](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#notes2). Use semantic markup whenever possible.
